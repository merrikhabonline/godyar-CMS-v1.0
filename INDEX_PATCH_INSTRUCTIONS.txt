Index.php patch (optional)

If you cannot modify .htaccess, you can include language_prefix_router.php early.

Example (public_html/index.php):

<?php
require_once __DIR__ . '/language_prefix_router.php';
require_once __DIR__ . '/includes/bootstrap.php';
...

If your project uses a different public entrypoint, include it there instead.
